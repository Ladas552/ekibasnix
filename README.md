# Why exist/name/public?
- I need a place to store my config to not accidentally delete it(happened before)

- My city of birth is named similarly. Eki = Two, bas = head, tuz= salt. Like this, I will try to have 2 configurations here. Flake NixOS and Home-manager. 2 heads of Nix

- I had problems when first trying out Nix. I hope this config could also help others as so many helped me

# What are the plans
1. ~Migrate my NixOS to flake~
2. ~Make Nix Secrets to not doxx myself~
3. Write comments for not forgetting functions and what I did even config
4. Declare much more packages
5. Declare Nix with Neorg tangle
6. ~Make secure SSH connection to my phone to edit on the go~

# Why Archived? 
I want to try to use my Home-manager as a module to NixOS and not standalone, following that I don't use HM with other OS if anything. And I have seen the benefits for reproduce ability with it being a module.

And it all requires quite a big refactor that changes config drastically. So starting from a different repository would be easier. 

Also, some people might prefer having standalone NixOS and Home-manager, so I will just leave this configuration there. I will not add any changes to it even if somethings are broken.

Also Ekibasnix name now will loose all meaning. And idk how to change repository name with a link in GitHub. So yeah, that is also a reason :P
