# Why exist/name/public?
- I need a place to store my config to not accidentally delete it(happened before)

- My city of birth is named similarly. Eki = Two, bas = head, tuz= salt. Like this, I will try to have 2 configurations here. Flake NixOS and Home-manager. 2 heads of Nix

- I had problems when first trying out Nix. I hope this config could also help others as so many helped me

# What are the plans
1. Migrate my NixOS to flake
2. Make Nix Secrets to not doxx myself
3. Write comments for not forgetting functions and what I did even config
4. Declare much more packages
5. Declare Nix with Neorg tangle
